# Project-COVID
Rudimentary Python Project

*Synopsis*  
  
This project is named “Project C.O.V.I.D” or “Custom Operated Variable Input Dashboard”. It  is a cross platform Python program integrating  MySQL and File Handling. 
I aimed to create a program that is useful in a  wide range of circumstances and easy to use for  users of varying age groups and technical  capabilities. It is visually appealing and requires low system resources (9MB executable file). 
The file handling capabilities of the program  include working with text files, binary files and  CSV files. Everything is enhanced to be simple  and almost no prior knowledge is required to  edit and do the needful. 
Chances of error are greatly reduced by using  well established try-except blocks of code.

*Imports* 
  
The following Python modules were imported: 
1. Time module: This module provides various  time related functions. 
2. mysql.connector: This module enables Python  programs to access MySQL databases.  
3. OS: This module allows the program to  interface with the underlying operating system  that Python is running on. 
4. Clrprint: This module is used to print coloured  output. 
5. Pickle module: This module is used for  serialising and de-serialising a Python object  structure. 
6. CSV module: This module is used to read and  write tabular data in CSV format.
   
*Scope of Improvement*   

1.Expand the domain of work of file handling  features. 
2.Reduce manual updating due to technical  issues. 
3.Make the interface even more interactive. 
4.Minimize the requirement of any prior  knowledge while working with the program.
